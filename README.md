# Drawing-a-half-hrrow
Write a program that outputs a downwards facing arrow composed of a rectangle and a right triangle. Arrow dimensions are defined by user specified arrow base height, arrow base width, and arrow head width.

Step 1. Input the arrow base height (int) and width (int). Draw a rectangle using asterisks (height x width). Hint: use a nested loop in which the inner loop draws one row of *s, and the outer loop iterates a number of times equal to the height. 

Step 2. Input the arrow head width and draw a right triangle. Hint: use a nested loop. Submit for grading to confirm four tests pass.

Step 3. Modify the program to only accept an arrow head width that is larger than the arrow base width. Use a loop to continue inputting the arrow head width until the value is larger than the arrow base width.
